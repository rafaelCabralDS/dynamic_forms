## Dynamic Forms

A flutter package that makes it easier to create highly custom long forms with just a few lines of code.

Features:

- Parse your forms output to JSON easily.
- Create forms from JSON schemes to create dynamic forms from databases.
- Validate your forms simply by calling the validate method from the FormController.
- Supports multiple kinds of fields such as:
  -- Text Fields: text, password, email, phone, cpf, cnpj, dates.\n
  -- Checkboxes, switches, dropdowns, files.\n
  -- Lists: Add as many fields as you need dynamically with expandable fields.\n
  -- Tables: Create tables easily to extract data.\n
- Have total control over the style of the form and the field using the DynamicFormTheme widget, overriding specific fields style by their names/key when needed.
- And more!
